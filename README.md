Instructions for local deployment:
- Clone this repository into your projects folder
- Run bundle install
- Run rake db:create
- Run rake db:setup
- Add Stripe API keys to the your project (see below instructions)
- Startup server and enjoy!

Setting up Stripe API keys on your local environment:
- Go to [www.stripe.com](http://www.stripe.com) and create an account
- Go into your account settings (under Your Account) and click on API Keys.
- In the project root directory, create a new file named .env and add the following lines to it:

```
PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[paste your Test Publishable Key here]
SECRET_KEY=[paste your Test Secret Key here]
```

- Open the .gitignore file and add `.env` to it

- In the config/initializers directory, add a file named "stripe.rb" and add this code:

```
  Rails.configuration.stripe = {
    :publishable_key => ENV['PUBLISHABLE_KEY'],
    :secret_key      => ENV['SECRET_KEY']
  }

  Stripe.api_key = Rails.configuration.stripe[:secret_key]
```

- Once these steps are completed, you will be able to use the "Pay With Credit Card" button
on the Review order page.
